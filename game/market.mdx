## Market Overview

The in-game market lets you purchase items using your **Tickets** (earned by leveling up). Items provide bonuses that last for the current session only.

<Warning>
**Tickets** are a scarce resource! You only get 1 ticket per level, so spend them wisely.
</Warning>

## How the Market Works

1. **Access Market** - Click the shop icon during gameplay
2. **View Items** - See 3 available items per refresh
3. **Purchase** - Spend **Tickets** to buy items
4. **Refresh** - Pay **Score** to refresh available items

## Item Categories

### Score Boosters
Increase the base points of specific symbols.

| Item | Effect | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| Diamond Polish | +X pts to Diamond | Diamond: 50 → 60 pts |
| Lucky Seven | +X pts to Seven | Seven: 30 → 40 pts |
| Cherry Juice | +X pts to Cherry | Cherry: 20 → 28 pts |

### Pattern Multipliers
Increase multipliers for specific pattern types.

| Item | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Horizontal Focus | +0.5x to horizontal patterns |
| Vertical Master | +0.5x to vertical patterns |
| Diagonal Vision | +0.5x to diagonal patterns |

### Utility Items

#### La Biblia
<Card title="666 Protection" icon="book">
**Effect:** Saves you once from a 666 game over

When 666 would trigger, La Biblia is consumed and you continue playing. This is the only way to survive 666!
</Card>

#### Spin Tokens
<Card title="Extra Spins" icon="rotate-right">
**Effect:** Adds bonus spins when leveling up

Instead of getting 5 spins per level, you get 5 + bonus.
</Card>

## Item Stacking

Multiple items of the same type **stack additively**:

```
Example: Two "+5 Diamond" boosters
Diamond base: 50 pts
After items: 50 + 5 + 5 = 60 pts
```

## Market Refresh

### Cost
- Refreshing the market costs a percentage of score
- Cost increases with each refresh

### Free Refresh (Inferno Relic)
- The **Inferno** relic provides one free market refresh
- After using, normal refresh costs apply

## Strategy Tips

1. **Early Investment** - Buy score boosters early to maximize benefit over many spins
2. **La Biblia Priority** - If available, consider buying protection against 666
3. **Pattern Synergy** - Combine pattern multipliers with score boosters for maximum effect
4. **Risk vs Reward** - Higher item costs mean less score buffer if you lose

## Technical: Item Effects

Items are stored per-session in the contract:

```cairo
struct SessionItem {
    item_id: u32,
    quantity: u32,
}
```

Effects are applied during:
- **Score calculation** - Symbol and pattern bonuses
- **666 check** - La Biblia consumption
- **Level up** - Spin bonus application
