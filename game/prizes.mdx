## Prize Pool System

Abyss features a competitive prize pool where players compete for real token rewards.

### How it Works

1. **Every session costs $1** (payable in ETH, STRK, or other allowed tokens)
2. **50% of each entry** goes to the prize pool
3. At season end, prizes are **distributed to top 5 players**
4. Multiple tokens accumulate in the prize pool

## Leaderboard

The global leaderboard ranks all players by their **highest session score**.

<Note>
Only scores from **competitive sessions** (with CHIP deposit) count for the leaderboard.
</Note>

### Ranking Criteria
- **Primary:** Highest total score achieved in a single session
- **Tiebreaker:** Earlier timestamp wins

## Prize Distribution

When prizes are distributed, the top 5 players receive:

| Rank | Prize Share |
|------|-------------|
| 🥇 **1st Place** | 40% |
| 🥈 **2nd Place** | 25% |
| 🥉 **3rd Place** | 18% |
| **4th Place** | 10% |
| **5th Place** | 7% |

### Dynamic Distribution

If fewer than 5 players are on the leaderboard:

| Players | Distribution |
|---------|--------------|
| 1 player | 100% to 1st |
| 2 players | 60% / 40% |
| 3 players | 50% / 30% / 20% |
| 4 players | 43% / 27% / 19% / 11% |
| 5+ players | 40% / 25% / 18% / 10% / 7% |

## Multi-Token Prize Pool

The prize pool can hold **multiple tokens**:

- **ETH** - Ethereum
- **STRK** - Starknet token
- **CHIP** - Game native token
- Other ERC20 tokens added by admin

Each token is distributed separately according to the same percentages.

### Viewing the Prize Pool

1. The **Leaderboard page** - Click "View Prize Pool"
2. Directly querying the contract

```typescript
// Get all prize tokens and their balances
const balances = await getPrizeTokenBalances();
// Returns: [{ address, symbol, balance }, ...]
```
